# ðŸŽ¨ Gallery Genie - AI Art Classifier & Recommendation System

An intelligent art classification and recommendation system that combines computer vision and similarity search to help users discover artworks. Built with a fine-tuned VGG16 model and FAISS vector search on a massive 500k artwork dataset.

## Features

### Art Classification
- **Style Recognition**: Classifies artwork into different artistic styles and movements
- **Top-5 Predictions**: Returns the 5 most likely style classifications with confidence scores
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast inference using optimized YOLO and VGG models

### Smart Recommendations
- **Visual Similarity**: Finds artworks visually similar to uploaded images
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses VGG16 block5_pool features with Global Average Pooling
- **FAISS Search**: Lightning-fast similarity search across 500k+ artworks
- **Style Filtering**: Recommends artworks from similar artistic styles

### Performance
- **Scalable**: Handles large-scale artwork databases efficiently
- **Fast API**: RESTful API built with FastAPI for production deployment
- **Optimized Models**: Custom VGG16 architecture fine-tuned for art classification

## Architecture

### Models Used
- **Classification**: Custom YOLO model fine-tuned on artwork dataset
- **Feature Extraction**: Modified VGG16 with Global Average Pooling
- **Similarity Search**: FAISS index for efficient nearest neighbor search

### Data Pipeline
1. **Image Upload**: Users upload artwork images via API
2. **Classification**: YOLO model predicts artistic style
3. **Feature Extraction**: VGG16 extracts visual features
4. **Similarity Search**: FAISS finds most similar artworks
5. **Recommendations**: Returns curated list of similar artworks
